# clickhouse_integrations

A simple showcase of how a ClickHouse server can be accessed via the MySQL protocol to be used in different notebooks and JS.

## Demo JS app

The /javascript folder contains a Node.js app that uses [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to access a locally running ClickHouse server and [dc.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/) for graph rendering.

- The first horizontal bar graph shows the average property paid price by county, sorted by price descending.
- The second horizontal bar graph shows total count of property items sold by county, sorted by item count descending.
- Data can be filtered to only include sales made in a specific time period, using the filter at the top of the page (from 1995 to 2022).
- Data can also be filtered by property type and property hold duration using the select filters at the top of the page.

### Running the app

Before running the JS app, make sure to have a running [ClickHouse server](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/quick-start) with the [UK Property Price Paid](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/getting-started/example-datasets/uk-price-paid/) dataset imported.

To run the JS server app on your machine:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Download this repository to your machine.
3. Go to the /javascript folder in the terminal and install npm package dependencies by running this command:
```
npm install
```
4. Run the app using this command:
```
node app
```
The default port for this app is 3000, so once the app is running the page can be accessed locally on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

## Demo JS app (using HTTP)

The /javascript_http folder contains an app that provides similar functionality, but uses HTTP protocol instead to access ClickHouse. It connects to the public ClickHouse playground which provides the same dataset, so there is no need to set up your own ClickHouse server. To use it, simply download the HTML file along with the JS script, put them in the same folder, and view the HTML file in your browser.
